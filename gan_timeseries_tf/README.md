This release includes codes on adversarial nets we use for the training of time series characteristics. The gained characteristics are implicitly represented in the deep network, where the generative nets can produce time series highly similar to original training data from the perspective of statistics, while the discriminative nets can be used with other various classifiers as a classification tool. Tests on 85 datasets of a UCR time series collection show a satisfying result.
